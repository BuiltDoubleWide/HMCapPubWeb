        <h1>The beginnings</h1>
        <p>Our founder Billy Box was not the wisest man around. But there was one thing that annoyed him more than anything not having a box for his items that was just the right size. Always either too small or too big. Too square or too round. Maybe not even strong enough. Boxes for shipping, boxes for storage, and boxes for signage. So he got to talking with some folks and things lead to another making Big Box Co.</p>
